I'm a person who loves programming and discovering new ways in this programming world! I am currently working on many projects for the community. One of my main projects is Adobly, an organization that will support you in your programming path. I have 4 years programming, I started approximately on March 1, 2020, but I was always attracted by this world of virtual technologies. I invite you to take a little trip through my repositories to see a little of my projects and what they are about. 🧶
